# This is the repository for my Machine Learning Decision Tree Model implementation from scratch and testing of it with iris and wine datasets 

##Instructions on how to use the repo and notebooks are as follows:

* Clone the repository
* Open the "DTL API Complete" file which has the implementation of the DTL API and testing on a different dataset (titanic)
* Open the "DTL assingment with testing of each function" file to see implementation and testing alongside with some interesting plots
* Make sure the Datasets are in the same folder to avoid directory errors
